# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Respository to perform various machine learning models to predict credit risk

## Overview of Credit Risk Analysis
The objective of this exercise is to create multiple machine learning models using statistics, undersamplimng, oversampling to decide which one is best for predicting credit risk

## Results
The following models were evaluated for predicting the credit risk:

**- Naive Random Oversampling: The balanced accuracy score is around 67%**

**- SMOTE Oversampling: The balanced accuracy score is around 66%**

**- Cluster Centroid Undersampling: The balanced accuracy score is around 54%**

**- Ada Booster Classifier: The balanced accuracy score is around 68%**

## Summary

None of the models have a high accuracy as the best prediction accuracy is also just 79% of the Random Forest model which is low accuracy. Better models should be evaluated.
